# CelebA-GAN

• I roughly followed the deep convolutional GAN framework in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf.

• I used the CelebA dataset: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html. 

• The output of a similar algorithm deep learning algorithm (has more layers in its generator and discriminator networks) trained on landscape paintings can be found at: https://twitter.com/deep_landscapes.
