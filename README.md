# DCGAN

• I roughly followed the deep convolutional GAN framework in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf).

• I used the [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). 

• The output of a similar deep learning algorithm (has more layers in its generator and discriminator networks) trained on landscape paintings can be found [here](https://twitter.com/deep_landscapes).
